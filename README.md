**MuleBuy Popup Remover**
-
Simple chrome extension which opens a popup with a button which should remove any warnings you may get trying to look at products on MuleBuy.

Feel free to fork this and automate the removal of the popup, I think for most people's needs this works fine. I'm also lazy.

**Installation Guide**

- on the github, click the green `code` button then `Download ZIP`

- unzip the folder

- open `chrome://extensions` in your browser

- in the top right, flip `Developer Mode` on

- drag and drop the extension folder into there, should work

- have fun
